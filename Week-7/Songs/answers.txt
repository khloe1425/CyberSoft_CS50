If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018,
how would you characterize their audio aura?

    +-------------+--------------+-------------------+
    | AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
    +-------------+--------------+-------------------+
    | 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
    +-------------+--------------+-------------------+

    Based on the previus query result, we can say that
    the audio aura of the listener is characterized by
    high energy (0.65906), high danceability (0.71646),
    and moderate valence (0.484443).


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might
not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of
calculating this aura would you propose?

    We can improve the computation of the audio aura by
    taking into account factors such as the time that a
    user spends on each song, the tempo, and the
    instrumentation, as well as by asking the user to
    provide more information about their emotional state
    when listening to certain songs. This will help to
    refine the calculation and create a more accurate
    and personalized audio aura.
