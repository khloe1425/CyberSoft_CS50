Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
When running a small number of simulations the output can be random,
for example a team like Brazil can have one time a chance of 60%, next time 10%.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
When running 10000 simulations the output stabilized, showing Belgium as the favourite,
followed up by Brazil. After 10000 simulations, the results usually show the same,
so I'd consider 10000 to be good enough.
